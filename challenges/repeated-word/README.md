Challenge: Repeated Word

# Description

Challenge: Repeated Word

# Requirements

- Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
- Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
- Create a branch in your repository called repeated_word

On your branch, createâ€¦
- Python: a file called repeated_word.py
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.

Feature Tasks
- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
