# Project BST

## Description
Binary Search Tree (BST) is a common data structure that keeps its Node Values in a sorted order, determined by the BST creator. 

This binary search tree uses an integer system to determine where to store information, and any data passed into this system will need to have a unique numeric ID. This is not a rebalancing tree, so new records are written in relation to the ID of the root value.


### Setup

Python 3.6 is required for this project, as is a code editor (VSCode was used for this project) and Pytest plug-in. 


### Getting started

This project was written using Test Driven Development (TDD). User will want to become familiar with TDD, and start BST development by building code to pass the tests included in this repository using Pytest and an open Command Line window.

Files coded, in order:
1. __init__.py
2. test_bst.py
3. conftest.py
4. node.py
5. bst.py
