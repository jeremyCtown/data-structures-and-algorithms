# K-ary Tree

No idea what I'm doing, but what's new?!?

## Description
K-ary tree is basically a directory where files are added as endpoints inside of subdirectories. When a new file is added, it is appended as a child to an existing Node.

## Usage
Great for organizing files, thoughts, really whatever you want. Did you know that dogs really like tennis balls? It's going to take me a bit to get back into the swing of these...

## Setup
- Create a Class or a Node which is aware of the value as val and children as a list collection of Nodes
- Ensure that you have a __repr__ and __str__ method defined to return appropriate representations of the node
- Create a Class for a KTree, which is aware of the root of the tree as root
- Ensure that you have a __repr__ and __str__ method defined to return appropriate representations of the tree
- This class should be aware of depth-first traversal methods for pre_order, and post_order traversals
- This class should be aware of a breadth-first traversal method
- This class should have the ability to insert a new node into the tree at a given parent node
