# K-ary Tree

No idea what I'm doing, but what's new?!?

## Description
K-ary tree is basically a directory where files are added as endpoints inside of subdirectories. When a new file is added, it is appended as a child to an existing Node, but I don't really know how that is supposed to be set up. This is why Jeebus invented computers.

## Usage
Great for organizing files, thoughts, really whatever you want. Did you know that dogs really like tennis balls? It's going to take me a bit to get back into the swing of these...
