# Queue with Stacks

Holy crap I'm tired... wish I could merge some more time in to my day

## Challenge
Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
You have access to 2 Stack instances with push and pop methods.
